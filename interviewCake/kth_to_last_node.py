O(n) time and O(1)O(1) space, where nn is the length of the list.

More precisely, it takes nn steps to get the length of the list, and another n-knâˆ’k steps to reach the target node.
In the worst case k=1k=1, so we have to walk all the way from head to tail again to reach the target node. 
This is a total of 2n2n steps, which is O(n)O(n).
